morning and evening  
maids heard the goblins cry:  
“come buy our orchard fruits,  
come buy, come buy:  
apples and quinces(木梨)  
lemons(柠檬) and oranges(橙),  
plump unpeck’d cherries,  
melons(甜瓜) and raspberries(树莓),  
bloom-down-cheek’d peaches(桃),  
swart-headed mulberries(桑椹),  
wild free-born cranberries(蔓越莓),  
crab(山楂)-apples, dewberries(木莓),  
pine(菠萝)-apples, blackberries(黑莓),  
apricots(杏仁), strawberries(草莓);  
all ripe together  
in summer weather,—  
morns that pass by,  
fair eves that fly;  
come buy, come buy:  
our grapes(葡萄) fresh from the vine,  
pomegranates(石榴) full and fine,  
dates(椰枣) and sharp bullaces(野李),  
rare pears(梨) and greengages(青梅),  
damsons(洋李) and bilberries(越橘),  
taste them and try:  
currants(醋栗) and gooseberries(鹅莓),  
bright-fire-like barberries(伏牛子),  
figs(无花果) to fill your mouth,  
citrons(香橼) from the south,  
sweet to tongue and sound to eye;  
come buy, come buy.”
